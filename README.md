# Leave Management System

## Description
The Leave Management System is a Salesforce application designed to streamline the process of applying for and managing leaves. The system includes a Lightning Web Component (LWC) for applying for leaves such as planned leave, sick leave, and unpaid leaves. Users can add reasons for the leaves when applying. After applying, users can also edit leaves that are neither approved nor rejected. Applied leaves are sent to senior managers for approval or rejection with reasons.
